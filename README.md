# ExpenseTracker
Expense Tracking Program that is designed to tell you where you are spending too much money

The reasoning for this project is for me to be able to expand on my knowledge of the Java programming language and to apply my knowledge to create an application that can be used in everyday life by anyone. 

This project will be completed during my 1st year of university and may potentially be rolled out onto the app store if I get it to a point where I am ready to release it.
